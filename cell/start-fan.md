title: Starting the fan
order: 30
---

The fan of the cell is not running.

# How do I start the fan?
Have you [got out of the cell](cell-door.md) and explored the room, fully?

## What am I looking for?
Did you notice you can peek the window in the door?

# I looked into the window
You see the guard making food on the stove.

# What should I do with the stove?
Throw something on the stove. That smell should make the guard start air conditioning.

## What should I throw on the stove?
Take the boot that is next to the cell door. Throw the boot on the stove.

# The guard will notice me, then
Not if he is turned away. Throw the boot on the stove when the guard is turned away from the stove.

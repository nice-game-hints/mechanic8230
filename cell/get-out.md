title: Getting out of the room
order: 20
---

After you [open the cell door](cell-door.md) you notice all the other doors are locked.

# What is my way out?
Inspect the fan on the wall. That is your way out.

# What should I do to the fan?
Break it, somehow. Did you try any items on it?

# Ivog says I need something longer
You would need [a rope](rope.md).

# I have a rope
Then you need something that will let you attach the rope to the fan.

# What should I use?
Maybe you should _sit down_ and think about it for a while...

## Sit down?
Sit on the armchair. You will get a spring. Combine the spring with the rope. You have a makeshift grappling hook.

Use the grappling hook on the fan.

# The rope is now attached to the fan. What next?
[Start the fan.](start-fan.md)

title: Opening the floor hatch
order: 20
---

There is no handle or lock in the floor hatch.

# How to open the hatch?
I think the answer lies on the levers.

Try to [begin the procedure](levers.md).

# I got 100% but the hatch is closed
Did you spot new items appear?

## What item?
Take the sting on the blue bed.

## Where should I put the sting?
Insert the sting into the free socket next to the yellow and blue levers.

You got a new lever. Pull the lever to open the hatch.

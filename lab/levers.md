There are two levers, yellow and blue.

# What should I do to the levers?
Pull the levers.

# What am I aiming to?
Notice the percent on the display. The number will go up from either lever or reset.

# Any more hints?
Have you read the notes on top of the red button?

## What note?
The bottom note says.

## What does it say, again?
"Starting the procedure: pull the yellow lever 3 times, blue twice, yellow once, blue 3 times and yellow once."

Just do as the note says. Check that the percent number is raising.
